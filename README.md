# 🧰 Garage Management System (Salesforce Project)

---

## 📖 Overview
The **Garage Management System (GMS)** is a Salesforce-based cloud application developed to digitalize and automate operations in automotive service centers.  
It provides modules for **customer management, service scheduling, mechanic assignment, billing, inventory tracking, and performance reporting** — all integrated within the Salesforce Lightning platform.

This system helps garage owners and service providers streamline daily operations, eliminate manual errors, and improve customer satisfaction.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate day-to-day garage operations through Salesforce.  
- Maintain detailed and centralized records of customers, vehicles, and services.  
- Enable quick appointment booking and mechanic allocation.  
- Generate bills automatically and track payment history.  
- Create dashboards for visual analytics on business performance.  
- Improve overall service efficiency and customer engagement.

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Garages and auto-service centers often manage records manually, leading to inefficiency and poor customer experience. There is no centralized system to manage customer details, appointments, or billing.  
This project aims to create a **Salesforce-based Garage Management System** to overcome these challenges by providing a **fully automated, scalable, and user-friendly platform**.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
The proposed system automates all garage-related activities by integrating them into a single Salesforce application.  
- Customers can register their vehicles and book services.  
- Admins can assign mechanics and monitor service progress.  
- Billing and reports are generated automatically.  
- Dashboards offer insights into performance, costs, and workload.  

This ensures transparency, accuracy, and operational efficiency.
